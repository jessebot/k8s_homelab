[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is an open source IoT management solution. We deploy a [small-hack maintained helm chart](https://github.com/small-hack/home-assistant-chart/) by default.

<img src="../../assets/images/screenshots/home-assistant_screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of the home-assistant-app in Argo CD showing a tree featuring a configmap, pvc, service, service account, deployment, and ingress resource all called home-assistant.">

The main variable you need to worry about when setting up home assistant is your `hostname`.

*NOTE*: You'll need to enable the [Generic Device Plugin](/k8s_apps/generic-device-plugin.md) as a prereq in order to use USB devices with home assistant.

## Example configs

### Using tolerations and node affinity

```yaml
apps:
    description: |
      [link=https://home-assistant.io]Home Assistant[/link] is a home IOT management solution.

      By default, we assume you want to use node affinity and tolerations to keep home assistant pods on certain nodes and keep other pods off said nodes. If you don't want to use either of these features but still want to use the small-hack/argocd-apps repo, first change the argo path to /home-assistant/ and then remove the 'toleration_' and 'affinity' secret_keys from the yaml file under apps.home_assistant.description.

      [b]NOTE[/b]: If you want to pass in a USB device, you will need the generic device plugin (which is available as a default Argo CD app via smol-k8s-lab ðŸ’™)

      This app takes one sensitive value, password for the initial owner user. You can also pass it in as an enviornment variable called $HOME_ASSISTANT_PASSWORD.
    # Initialization of the app through smol-k8s-lab
    init:
      # enable the creation of an initial owner user
      enabled: true
      values:
