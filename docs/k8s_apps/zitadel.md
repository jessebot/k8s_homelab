Zitadel is one of the more complex apps that `smol-k8s-lab` supports out of the box. For initialization, you need to pass in the following info:

- `username` - name of the first admin user to create
- `email` - email of the first admin user
- `first name` - first name of the first admin user
- `last name` - last name of the first admin user
- `gender` - optional - the gender of the first admin user

The above values are used to create an initial user. We also create Argo CD admin and users groups to be used with an Argo CD OIDC app that we prepare. If Vouch is enabled, we also create an OIDC app for that as well as a user group. You initial user is automatically added to all the groups we create.

Finally, we create a groupsClaim so that all queries for auth also process the user's groups.

In addition to those one time init values, we also require a hostname to use for the Zitadel API and web frontend.

## Sensitive values
You can provide the following values as environment variables:

- `ZITADEL_S3_BACKUP_ACCESS_ID`
- `ZITADEL_S3_BACKUP_SECRET_KEY`
- `ZITADEL_RESTIC_REPO_PASSWORD`

## Example config

```yaml
apps:
  zitadel:
    enabled: false
    description: |
      [link=https://zitadel.com/opensource]ZITADEL[/link] is an open source self hosted IAM platform for the cloud era

      smol-k8s-lab supports initialization of:
        - an admin service account
        - a human admin user (including an autogenerated password)
        - a project with a name of your chosing
        - 2 OIDC applications for Argo CD and Vouch
        - 2 Argo CD groups (admins and users), 1 vouch groups
        - groupsClaim action to enforce group roles on authentication
        - updates your appset_secret_plugin secret and refreshes the pod

      The default app will also deploy SeaweedFS to backup your database which in turn is backed up to a remote s3 provider of your choice.

      To provide sensitive values via environment variables to smol-k8s-lab use:
        - ZITADEL_S3_BACKUP_ACCESS_ID
        - ZITADEL_S3_BACKUP_SECRET_KEY
        - ZITADEL_RESTIC_REPO_PASSWORD
    init:
      # Switch to false if you don't want to create initial secrets or use the
      # API via a service account to create the above described resources
      enabled: true
      values:
        username: 'certainlynotadog'
