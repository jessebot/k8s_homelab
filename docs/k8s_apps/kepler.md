[Kepler](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler) (Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter) is a newly added and supported k8s app that uses eBPF to probe energy-related system stats and exports them as Prometheus metrics.

This app is still in alpha state as we learn more about how best to configure it. In the meantime, to our knowledge you can start playing with it after installing it alongside [cilium](/k8s_apps/cilium.md).
