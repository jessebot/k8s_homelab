We use the Bitwarden ESO Provider along side the [external-secrets-operator](/k8s_apps/external-secrets-operator.md) to pull secret data from your Bitwarden vault, into the cluster as [Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

<img src="/images/screenshots/bweso_screenshot.png" alt="a screenshot of the Argo CD web interface showing the bitwarden-eso-provider application in tree view mode. it shows the following children of bitwarden-eso-provider: test-connection configmap, bitwarden-eso-provider service,bitwarden-eso-provider service account, bitwarden-eso-provider deployment, bitwarden-fields cluster secret store, bitwarden-login cluster secret store. the deployment then points to additonal replica sets which point to a single pod">

`smol-k8s-lab` stores any sensitive user specific data about applications in your Bitwarden vault. Some examples include admin credentials, database credentials, and OIDC credentials.

Head over to the [Bitarden ESO Provider helm chart](https://github.com/jessebot/bitwarden-eso-provider/) to learn more, and then see how it is configured at [small-hack/argocd-apps](https://github.com/small-hack/argocd-apps/blob/main/external-secrets-operator/bitwarden/bitwarden_argocd_app.yaml).

## Sensitive values
To use the Bitwarden provider, we need your Client Secret, Client ID, _and_ your Bitwarden password. You can choose to provide these as one time values each time your run smol-k8s-lab, or you can export the following environment variables before running `smol-k8s-lab`:

- `BITWARDEN_PASSWORD`
- `BITWARDEN_CLIENTSECRET`
- `BITWARDEN_CLIENTID`

## default yaml configuration

For Bitwarden, if you'd like to deploy it alongside the External Secrets Operator, you just need to set your provider for the `apps_global_config.external_secrets` paramter to "bitwarden" in your config.yaml. Make sure that `apps.external_secrets_operator.enabled` is also set to `true`.

```yaml
apps_global_config:
  # Must be a string of "" (don't use external secrets) or "bitwarden" to use bitwarden for external secrets*
  external_secrets: "bitwarden"

apps:
  external_secrets_operator:
    enabled: true
    description: |
      [link=https://external-secrets.io/latest/]External Secrets Operator[/link] is a Kubernetes operator that integrates external secret management systems like HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk Conjur, Bitwarden, Gitlab, and many more. The operator reads information from external APIs and automatically injects the values into a Kubernetes Secret.

      To deploy the Bitwarden provider, please set apps_global_config.external_secrets to "bitwarden".

      The [link="https://github.com/jessebot/bitwarden-eso-provider/"]Bitwarden External Secrets Provider[/link] is used to store k8s secrets in BitwardenÂ®. This deployment has no ingress and can't be connected to from outside the cluster. There is a networkPolicy that only allows the pod to communicate with the External Secrets Operator in the same namespaces.

      smol-k8s-lab support initialization by creating a Kubernetes secret with your Bitwarden credentials so that the provider can unlock your vault. You will need to setup an [link=https://bitwarden.com/help/personal-api-key/]API key[/link] ahead of time. You can pass these credentials in by setting the following environment variables:

      BITWARDEN_PASSWORD, BITWARDEN_CLIENTSECRET, BITWARDEN_CLIENTID
    # Initialization of the app through smol-k8s-lab
    init:
      enabled: false
