# K0s

[K0s](https://k0sproject.io/) is the simple, solid & certified Kubernetes distribution that works on any infrastructure: bare-metal, on-premise, edge, IoT devices, public & private clouds. It's 100% open source & free. k0s is easy to install with a single binary and scales well from a single node development environment to a very large production cluster.
