## Port Forwarding
If you want to access an app outside of port forwarding to test, you'll need to make sure your app's ingress is setup correctly and then you'll need to setup your router to port forward 80->80 and 443->443 for your WAN. then setup DNS for your domain if you want the wider internet to access this remotely.

## SSL/TLS

After SSL is working (if it's not, follow the steps in the [cert-manager common error troubleshooting guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/faq/acme/#common-errors)), you can also change the `letsencrypt-staging` value to `letsencrypt-prod` for any domains you own and can configure to point to your cluster via DNS.


# Other Notes

Check out the [`optional`](optional) directory for notes on specific apps

e.g. for postgres on k8s notes, go to [`./optional/postgres/README.md`](./optional/postgres/README.md)

Want to get started with argocd? If you've installed it via smol_k8s_homelab, then you can jump to here:
https://github.com/jessebot/argo-example#argo-via-the-gui

Otherwise, if you want to start from scratch, start here: https://github.com/jessebot/argo-example#argocd

Where is your persistent volume data? If you used the local path provisioner it is here:
`/var/lib/rancher/k3s/storage`

- The k3s knowledge here is in this [kauri.io self hosting guide](https://kauri.io/#collections/Build%20your%20very%20own%20self-hosting%20platform%20with%20Raspberry%20Pi%20and%20Kubernetes/%2838%29-install-and-configure-a-kubernetes-cluster-w/) is invaluable. Thank you kauri.io.

- This [encrypted secrets in helm charts guide](https://www.thorsten-hans.com/encrypted-secrets-in-helm-charts/) isn't the guide we need, but helm secrets need to be stored somewhere, and vault probably makes sense
