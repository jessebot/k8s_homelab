## ArgoCD
Want to get started with argocd? If you've installed it via smol_k8s_homelab, then you can jump to [this Tutorial](https://github.com/jessebot/argo-example#argo-via-the-gui) to get going :) Otherwise, if you want to start from scratch, start [https://github.com/jessebot/argo-example#argocd](https://github.com/jessebot/argo-example#argocd).

I also have another Argo CD repo over on GitLab with further examples you can checkout here: [https://gitlab.com/vleermuis_tech/goobernetes/argocd](https://gitlab.com/vleermuis_tech/goobernetes/argocd).
