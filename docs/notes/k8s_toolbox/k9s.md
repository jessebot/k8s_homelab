## K9s
[K9s](https://k9scli.io/) is a CLI to manager your clusters from the terminal. I personally never deploy the default kubernetes dashboard anymore and instead just use a combination of kubectl and k9s.

It also has plugins and integrates with additional k8s tooling, like [Popeye](https://popeyecli.io/), a utility that scans live Kubernetes cluster and reports potential issues with deployed resources and configurations.
