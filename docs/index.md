## About

`smol-k8s-lab`'s declarative workflow enables rapid iteration in production-like environments with minimal costs for failure. This makes it ideal for proof-of-concepts, prototyping, and benchmarking Kubernetes applications and distributions! üíô

By default, `smol-k8s-lab` deploys [Argo CD] + [Argo CD Appset Secret Plugin] which enables Argo CD to securely manage your lab via files in open-source Git repos. Additionally, a customized dark-theme is provided for Argo CD's incredibly useful web-interface.

## Installation

Please see [our installation guide](/installation)

## Usage

After you've followed the installation instructions, if you're *new* to `smol-k8s-lab`,  initialize a new config file by running:

```bash
# we'll walk you through any configuration needed
# before saving the config and deploying it for you
smol-k8s-lab
```

### Adding custom Applications

You can create any application you already have an Argo CD application repo for, by following a simple application yaml schema in `~/.config/smol-k8s-lab/config.yaml` like this:

```yaml
apps:
  # name of application to create in Argo CD
  cert_manager:
    # if set to false, we ignore this app
    enabled: true
    argo:
      # secret keys to pass to Argo CD Application Set Generator
      secret_keys:
        # Used for letsencrypt-staging, to generate certs. If set to "" and cert-manager.enabled is true
        # smol-k8s-lab will prompt for this value and save it back to this file for you.
        email: ""
      # If set to "", we'll instead use the repo, path, ref, namespace, and project_source_repos
      # git repo to install the Argo CD app from
      repo: "https://github.com/small-hack/argocd-apps"
      # path in the argo repo to point to. Trailing slash very important!
      path: "ingress/cert-manager/"
      # either the branch or tag to point at in the argo repo above
      ref: "main"
      # namespace to install the k8s app in
      namespace: "ingress"
      # source repos for cert-manager CD App Project (in addition to cert-manager.argo.repo)
      project_source_repos:
        - https://charts.jetstack.io
```

Note: the above application, cert-manager, is already included as a default application in smol-k8s-lab :)

# Under the hood
Note: this project is not officially affiliated with any of the below tooling or applications.


## Supported k8s distributions
We always install the latest version of Kubernetes that is available from the distro's startup script.

|  Distro    |         Description              |
|:----------:|:------------------------------------------------------|

## Default Installed Applications
Version is the helm chart version, or manifest version.

## Troubleshooting
If you're stuck, checkout the [Notes](https://jessebot.github.io/smol-k8s-lab/notes) to see if we also got stuck on the same thing at some point :) Under each Kubernetes distro or application, we'll have notes on how to learn more about it, as well as any errors we've already battled.


# Status
This is still in early beta, as we figure out all the apps and distros we want to support, and pin all the versions, but if you'd like to contribute or just found a :bug:, feel free to open an issue (or pull request), and we'll take a look! We'll try to get back to you asap!


## Development
smol-k8s-lab is written in Python and built and published using [Poetry]. You can check out the `pyproject.toml` for the versions of each library we install below:

- [bcrypt] (to pass a password to argocd and automatically update your Bitwarden)
- [rich] (this is what makes all the pretty formatted text in logs and `--help`)
- [textual] (this is the framework used for writing the TUI)
- [ruamel.yaml] (to handle the k8s yamls and configs while maintaining comments)
- [click] (handles arguments for the CLI)

We also utilize the [Bitwarden cli], for a password manager so you never have to see/know your Argo CD password.

## Things we don't handle (yet)

1. Port Forwarding

    If you want to access an app outside of port forwarding to test, you'll need to make sure your app's ingress is setup correctly and then you'll need to setup your router to port forward 80->80 and 443->443 for your WAN. Then, setup DNS for your domain if you want the wider internet to access this remotely.

2. High-Availability

    HA cluster design with K3s requires etcd or another external key-value store such as PostgreSQL. Smol-K8s-Lab deploys k3s in a single-node configuration using SQLite which can be used for multi-node configurations but is not suitable for high-availability.
