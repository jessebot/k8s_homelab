## Install a distro of k8s with smol-k8s-lab
Currently only being tested with k3s and kind.
```bash
# you can replace k3s with kind
./smol-k8s-lab k3s
```

#### Install some kubectl plugins (Optional)

These together make namespace switching better. Learn more about kubectx + kubens [here](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx).

```bash
kubectl krew update
kubectl krew install ctx
kubectl krew install ns
```

To install plugins from my newline-delimited krew file, run:

```bash
kubectl krew install < deps/kubectl_krew_plugins
```

#### Install @jessebot's `.bashrc_k8s` (optional)

You can copy over the rc file for some helpful aliases:

```bash
# copy the file to your home directory
cp deps/.bashrc_k8s ~

# load the file for your current shell
source ~/.bashrc_k8s
```

To have the above file sourced every new shell, copy this into your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
# include external .bashrc_k8s if it exists
if [ -f $HOME/.bashrc_k8s ]; then
    . $HOME/.bashrc_k8s
fi
```

### Uninstall distro with python script

```bash
# you can replace k3s with kind
./smol-k8s-lab k3s --delete
```
