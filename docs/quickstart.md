## Quickstart for `smol-k8s-lab`

You should be able to use `pip` to install things after you've got the one time
setup pre-reqs listed below.

<details>
  <summary>One time Pre-Req</summary>
- Python 3.11 (`brew install python3.11`)
- [brew](https://brew.sh)
- Have internet access.

```bash
# install prereqs like brew
./setup.sh
```

</details>

### Installation

```bash
# this will install smol-k8s-lab using python 3.11
pip3.11 install smol-k8s-lab
```

Then you should be able to show the help text :)

```bash
# this will show the help text
./smol-k8s-lab --help
```

The help should return this:

ðŸ”” Then you *have to edit* your `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR` (usually `~/.config/smol-k8s-lab/config.yaml`) to be your own values. Better cli options and Interactive config setup coming soon!

Here's an example file already filled out with comments:

```yaml
# FQDN to access your web interfaces
domain:
  # your base domain for use with subdomains below
  base: "coolwebsitefordogs.com"
  # subdomain for Argo CD, so this would be argocd.coolwebsitefordogs.com
  argo_cd: "argocd"

# metallb IPs used for DNS later (make sure they're not in use)
metallb_address_pool:
  # HAVE to be full CIDR notation
  - 192.168.90.01/32

# Used for letsencrypt-staging, to generate certs
email: "coolemailfordogs@verygooddogs.net"

# Use the external secrets provider with gitlab
external_secrets:
  gitlab:
    # going to be deprecated soon in favor of using another password manager
    # token from here: https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens
    access_token: "kjdfsk758934fkldsafds"
    namespace: "nextcloud"

log:
  # logging level, Options: debug, info, warn, error
  level: "info"
  # path of file to log to, disabled by default
  # file: "./smol-k8s-log.log"
```

## Install a distro of k8s with smol-k8s-lab
Currently only being tested with k3s and kind.
```bash
# you can replace k3s with kind
./smol-k8s-lab k3s
```

#### Install some kubectl plugins (Optional)

These together make namespace switching better. Learn more about kubectx + kubens [here](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx).

```bash
kubectl krew update
kubectl krew install ctx
kubectl krew install ns
```

To install plugins from my newline-delimited krew file, run:

```bash
kubectl krew install < deps/kubectl_krew_plugins
```

#### Install @jessebot's `.bashrc_k8s` (optional)

You can copy over the rc file for some helpful aliases:

```bash
# copy the file to your home directory
cp deps/.bashrc_k8s ~

# load the file for your current shell
source ~/.bashrc_k8s
```

To have the above file sourced every new shell, copy this into your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
# include external .bashrc_k8s if it exists
if [ -f $HOME/.bashrc_k8s ]; then
    . $HOME/.bashrc_k8s
fi
```

### Uninstall distro with python script

```bash
# you can replace k3s with kind
./smol-k8s-lab k3s --delete
```
