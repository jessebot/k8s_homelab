## Quickstart for `smol-k8s-lab`
This is aimed at being a much more scalable experience, but is still being worked on. So far, it works for k3s and kind.

### Pre-Req
- Python 3.10 (`brew install python3.10`)
- [brew](https://brew.sh)
- Have internet access.

```bash
# install prereqs
./setup.sh
# checkout the help :)
./smol-k8s-lab --help
```

The help should return this:

ðŸ”” Then you *Have To* edit the `config_sample.yml` to be your own values:

```yaml

```

## Install a distro of k8s with smol-k8s-lab
Currently only being tested with k3s and kind.
```bash
# you can replace k3s with kind
./smol-k8s-lab k3s
```

#### Install some kubectl plugins (Optional)
These together make namespace switching better. Learn more about kubectx + kubens [here](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx).
```bash
kubectl krew update
kubectl krew install ctx
kubectl krew install ns
```
To install plugins from my newline-delimited krew file, run:
```bash
kubectl krew install < deps/kubectl_krew_plugins
```

#### Install @jessebot's `.bashrc_k8s` (optional)
You can copy over the rc file for some helpful aliases:
```bash
# copy the file to your home directory
cp deps/.bashrc_k8s ~

# load the file for your current shell
source ~/.bashrc_k8s
```
To have the above file sourced every new shell, copy this into your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:
```
# include external .bashrc_k8s if it exists
if [ -f $HOME/.bashrc_k8s ]; then
    . $HOME/.bashrc_k8s
fi
```

### Uninstall distro with python script
```bash
# you can replace k3s with kind
./smol-k8s-lab k3s --delete
```
