# Submitting Pull Requests

If it's a doc fix, don't worry about testing, just explain what you're fixing and we're a-ok üëç

If it's a code fix, please:
- don't forget to bump the version in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/small-hack/smol-k8s-lab/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L3)
- test your code before submitting it and explain how you tested it in the pull request

## Development

`smol-k8s-lab` is written in Python. You can check out the [`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) for the versions of each library we install below:

- [bcrypt] (to pass a password to argocd and automatically update your Bitwarden)
- [rich] (this is what makes all the pretty formatted text in logs and `--help`)
- [textual] (this is the framework used for writing the TUI)
- [ruamel.yaml] (to handle the k8s yamls and configs while maintaining comments)
- [click] (handles arguments for the CLI)

We also utilize the [Bitwarden cli], for a password manager so you never have to see/know your Argo CD password.

NOTE: We're open to unit and integration tests btw! We just don't have anything but ci via Github Actions, because we weren't stable enough to justify them yet. ü§¶

### Prereqs

- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to manage our dependencies and virtual environments for python.
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/index.html#install) to manage pre-commit hooks, mostly related to poetry

```bash
git clone git@github.com:small-hack/smol-k8s-lab.git
cd smol-k8s-lab
pre-commit install
```

### virtual environment

Install the project locally after cloning it.

```bash
# this installs a local version of smol-k8s-lab that points to your cloned repo directly
poetry install
```

And then you can do all your development in a virtual environment by running:

```bash
# this sources the virtual env for this project
poetry shell

# this will print your version you're working on
smol-k8s-lab --version
```

When you're done playing with your environment, you can just type `exit` to leave the shell :)
